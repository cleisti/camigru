## An instagram/snapchat like web-app

The idea with the project was to learn the basics of creating a web-app for which users can sign up, upload and create content and modify their own settings. Languages allowed for the project were
- HTML
- CSS (framworks without JS allowed)
- Vanilla Javascript for frontend
- PHP for backend
- MySQL as database service

The subject suggested to structure the app as an MVC-application, which I completely missed. This project is built completely with a creative structure, and as I learned a lot during the project, the ways in which I handle requests differs somewhat in different parts.

Some comments that I got for possible <u>improvement</u> were
- to use foreign keys in the database
- variables for server URLs
- adding some demo users with seed data right att setup
